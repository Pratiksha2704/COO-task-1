description :         The simple calculator program in Python is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic operations. When the program is executed, it starts by prompting the user to input two numbers: num1 and num2. These numbers can be integers or floating-point values, allowing for both whole numbers and decimal calculations.

After entering the numbers, the program displays a menu of available operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is then asked to choose an operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, or 4 for division).

Based on the user's selection, the program performs the chosen arithmetic operation using predefined functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) that take the input numbers as parameters. The result of the operation is computed and displayed to the user in a formatted output message, showing the calculation along with the final result.

To handle potential errors like division by zero, the program checks the validity of the operation and performs appropriate error handling if necessary. For instance, if the user attempts division and the second number (num2) is zero, the program displays an error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.

This simple calculator program is a practical example of basic Python programming, showcasing input handling, conditional statements, function usage, and string formatting. It provides a clear and interactive way for users to perform common arithmetic operations quickly and efficiently.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the implementation of the simple calculator program demonstrates the fundamental concepts of Python programming for handling user input and performing calculations. By allowing users to input two numbers and choose from a set of operations, the program showcases interactivity and user engagement.

The use of functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) encapsulates the logic for each arithmetic operation, promoting code modularity and readability. Error handling is incorporated to ensure that operations are performed safely and efficiently, providing informative feedback to the user when necessary.Overall, the simple calculator program serves as a practical exercise for beginners in Python, highlighting the importance of 
structured programming and user interface design. It can be further expanded with additional features, such as handling more complex operations or integrating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for enhanced usability. Through this project, learners gain valuable experience in software development fundamentals while building a useful tool for performing everyday calculations.
